# Short-Quiz


### For this project I was tasked with creating a JavaScript short quiz. When you click the start button it will bring you to the questions page, once there you will be presented with 4 multiple choice questions. Click on the answer you believe to be right to the corresponding question. After you have answered said question, if you got it correct the time will tic down accordingly, if not you will be deducted 20 seconds. Once you have finished all 4 questions you will be brought to a final scores page!
